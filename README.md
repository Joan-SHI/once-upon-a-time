This is a little development server with live reload capability. Use it for hacking your HTML/JavaScript/CSS files, but not for deploying the final site.
Run "npm install -g live-server" in your command line to install "live-server@1.2.1".

2. Add a simple index.html in your repo to test the live-server. 

3. Run "live-server" in your command line. It should open a new window with the url similar to "http://127.0.0.1:59713/" or "http://127.0.0.1:8080/" and you can see your test page.
